# Technical Presentation
This repository is about the proposal of the technical parts that I have performed on the Mental Health dataset which I have downloaded from the Kaggle
## Introduction - 

In this proposal, I am going to do some data wrangling with the Timestamp column which contains both the date and timestamp for the dataset. I am going to split the Timestamp column into different columns named Date and Time. This will allow better readability and faster access to the data when it contains either Date or Time. 

## Background - 

The goal of the data wrangling is to smoothen the process of accessing the data and the retrieval of the desired data at a much faster rate. The Timestamp column contains both Date and Time mixed which sometimes is confusing if you want to use it in the query to obtain meaningful insights out of it. So, I will tell you how to split the column containing both time and date into two separate columns called Date and Time.

## Presentation Candidate - 

My name is Rajas Joshi and I have done my bachelor's in Business Administration. I have 7 months of work experience of working as an Incident Manager at Accenture India. My primary duty was to create daily reports showing the daily progress of the tickets resolved on the Service Now. 

## Sample Data Selection - 

The dataset that I have chosen today is the Mental Health Dataset, which has information about the mental health of people around the world. This dataset will help us understand the mental condition by gender, age, the time at which the record has been taken, occupation of the person, and the reasons behind the factors affecting stress causing mental health problems. This dataset is available on the Kaggle. 

## Technical Technique Demonstration - 

For this dataset, I have chosen to do data wrangling around the Timestamp column which consists of both date and time mixed. This mixed data is not easy to access when you are trying to do time-based analysis. To make it easier, I am planning to split the Timestamp column into two separate columns called Date and Time. This will make it easier to do time-based analysis and faster and more accurate data outputs. 

## Implementation Plan - 

I will be performing several actions over the weeks. 
Week 1: Data analysis and EDA using Python.
Week 2: Understanding the effect of the current column format and then making changes according to it.
Week 3: Using data wrangling techniques using Python, splitting the Timestamp column into two separate columns and comparing the performance of the new output to the old.

## Resources - 

The primary tool I will be using to access the data and do data wrangling on it would be Jupyter Notebook using Python. 
All the tasks will be performed using the Pandas library.

## Conclusion - 

In conclusion, The proposal gives an idea about the overall plan to do data wrangling on the Mental Health Dataset which is obtained from the Kaggle and this will be achieved by performing timeline-based tasks. The goal is to split the Timestamp column into two separate columns called Date and Time. Doing this makes it easier to perform time-based tasks resulting in more efficient time-based analysis of the mental health tends.
